## Q&A
### Why can’t it run on mobile?
- WebGL processes the AI image recognition in the browser, but mobile specs are too low for this. Without AWS or a remote server, it has to run locally on a PC.
### Why is setup needed?
- We're using JavaScript to fetch the Solana wallet, so it can't run only in Unity. You’ll need a local server since there’s no remote server.
